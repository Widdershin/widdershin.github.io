<p>One of the great things about tmux is that you can create flexible development layouts.</p>

<p>You can easily display the output of a command and auto update it using <code>watch</code>. It has a similar end user experience as <code>tail -f</code>, except for commands instead of files. For example:</p>

<p><code>$ watch git status</code></p>

<p><code>watch</code> will run <code>git status</code> every 2 seconds and display the output.</p>

<p>If you want color in your <code>git status</code>, you&rsquo;ll need to configure git to display color when being run by <code>watch</code>.</p>

<p><code>$ git config --global color.status always</code>
<code>$ watch --color git status</code></p>

<time datetime="2015-02-10T23:13:08+13:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 10<span>th</span>, 2015</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I discovered Sonic Pi. I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/117516352">Repl Electric</a> perform live at RubyConf AU. He gave a brief demo of Sonic Pi, a tool for progamming live music with Ruby. Instantly my eyes lit up. It was the instrument I&rsquo;d always wanted.</p>

<p>I tried it out the next day. It has a nice interface, but I&rsquo;m used to vim and living in the terminal. I googled &ldquo;vim sonic pi&rdquo;, but there was nothing I could see. I hunted round for a bit, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a command line interface either.</p>

<p>It was <a href="http://github.com/samaaron">Sam Aaron</a>  (the creator of Sonic Pi) who pointed me in the right direction, a blog post entitled <a href="https://joearms.github.io/2015/01/05/Connecting-Erlang-to-Sonic-Pi.html">Connecting Erlang to Sonic Pi</a>. It turned out that there was an undocumented method of controlling Sonic Pi externally.</p>

<p>The secret:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;osc-ruby&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;play 50&#39;</span> <span class="c1"># or whatever you want</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="ss">OSC</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;localhost&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4557</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/run-code&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That code sends an OSC message (<a href="http://osw.sourceforge.net/html/osc.htm">Open Sound Control</a>) to Sonic Pi, instructing it to run the given code just as if you had typed it in.</p>

<p>So I put together a simple command line interface to use Sonic Pi from the terminal. <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli">sonic-pi-cli</a>. I packaged it up as a gem, and released it into the wild.</p>

<p>You can install it with <code>gem install sonic-pi-cli</code> and then run music with <code>sonic_pi play 60</code> or <code>echo 'sample :loop_amen' | sonic_pi</code>.</p>

<p>I was really happy to have a working CLI for Sonic Pi. I quickly whipped up some vim binds so I could use Sonic Pi right from my editor.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="nb">noremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">r</span> :<span class="k">silent</span> <span class="k">w</span> <span class="p">!</span>sonic_pi<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">noremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>S :<span class="k">call</span> system<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;sonic_pi stop&quot;</span><span class="p">)&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can add these commands to your <code>.vimrc</code>, and voila, Sonic Pi in your vim. I use the spacebar as my leader key, so these shortcuts feel a lot like using Sonic Pi.</p>

<p>Now, the really amazing part comes. Less than a day since I first released <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli">sonic-pi-cli</a> on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sonic-pi-cli">RubyGems</a>, a few awesome projects have already put it to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rbnpi">Robin Newman</a> has used it to control Sonic Pi from his phone with a Raspberry Pi and telegram.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o-DY8qrm44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><a href="https://github.com/dermusikman">dermusikman</a> immediately started working on a vim plugin to bring as many features of Sonic Pi to vim as he can, <a href="https://github.com/dermusikman/sonicpi.vim">sonicpi.vim</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment, it contains the shortcuts from above, as well as auto completion for samples and the like, and the use of the .pi file format, with Ruby highlighting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely astounded by the awesome work that has been put out so rapidly by others in the community. I really love this aspect of open source. There&rsquo;s a good sense of collaboration through Github issues and <a href="https://gitter.im/samaaron/sonic-pi">gitter</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to contributing more to the Sonic Pi community in future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I tell people that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)">Rogue</a> has inspired me to write a blog post about privilege, I am generally met with a resounding bu-wha?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)">Rogue</a> is a simple game. You play as an adventurer, descending the 27 floors of a dungeon, collecting gold and loot, fighting monsters and avoiding traps, with the goal of retrieving the Amulet of Yendor and returning to the surface.</p>

<p>Rogue had a few things that made it different from many other games. The first, and the most important, is that when your character dies, you&rsquo;re dead forever. You&rsquo;re presented with a tombstone and some information about your life, but there&rsquo;s no respawn button.</p>

<p>Another crucial part of Rogue is what is known as Procedural Content Generation. In English, that means that the dungeons are new every time you play. Every character you play starts surrounded by different walls, with different risks, rewards, and horrible enemies awaiting.</p>

<p>The third essential part of Rogue is that it is very difficult to win. It takes hundreds of attempts, for most players, before they first reach the bottom of the dungeon, retrieve the amulet, and &ldquo;ascend&rdquo; to the surface. There are many ways to die in Rogue, and a typical player will experience most of them when they &ldquo;ascend&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In my mind, Rogue draws some striking parallels to real life. Your actions have serious consequences. It only takes a single mistake to cause your death. A seemingly strong character can easily get overwhelmed if you make the wrong call.</p>

<p>Like life, you are at the mercy of your surroundings. To succeed, you have to fight and make do with what is available to you, but it&rsquo;s not always enough. There comes a moment in (almost) every game where you find your back against the wall and meet your maker.</p>

<p>It was thinking about life in terms of Rogue when I had an &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moment as to how I could really phrase my feelings around privilege.</p>

<p>My life has been going pretty well recently. At the same time, I see people near and far facing hardship and sorrow. It makes me wonder what has led to our difference in circumstances.</p>

<p>I know that some people like to think that those successful in life fought harder, that hard work and perseverance can overcome any obstacle. While that might play a part, it seems impossible to deny that your start in life makes all the difference.</p>

<p>As an adventurer in Rogue, what you find on the first few floors of the dungeon will have a huge impact on your fate. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to find a good set of armor or the right potions on the first floor, you&rsquo;ll probably breeze through the early dungeon. You will survive some situations simply because you got lucky and had what others didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>In my mind, it&rsquo;s the same &ndash; to have parents that teach you to read before you start school. I was lucky enough to have parents that both taught me to learn and nourished the spark of curiosity inside of me. That seemingly small gift early on has had huge impacts throughout my life. If not for that, probably, you wouldn&rsquo;t be reading my blog.</p>

<p>I was extremely privileged to be born where and when I was, and to whom. I think it&rsquo;s important to consider that not everyone is so fortunate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about politics recently.</p>

<p>For most of my life, so far, I&rsquo;ve thought anarchists were delusional. A world without government? You&rsquo;d have to be crazy to think that&rsquo;s a good idea. In my mind, anarchists wanted to inflict chaos upon society.</p>

<p>It recently occurred to me that anarchists aren&rsquo;t crazy, just optimistic. I feel anarchy is about the belief that humanity might be capable of living together without <em>needing</em> a strong system of governance. I&rsquo;ve started to think anarchy might be about hope, not chaos and fear as I previously thought.</p>

<p>This realization came at a useful time. The election is happening soon, and I&rsquo;ve been watching my friends and acquaintances discuss politics on Facebook. The most disheartening thing to me is the division between supporters of the different parties. I&rsquo;ve seen people removing each other as internet friends, simply because they support a different party. To me, this speaks of an unwillingness to consider and understand why other people think the way they do.</p>

<p>All of my beliefs and opinions exist simply because they were what made sense to me at the time. When you drive away from people who think differently from you, you limit your view of the world. In effect, you create a feedback loop that supports your views (the technical internet term is a &lsquo;circlejerk&rsquo;).</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that we try and break out of the echo chamber of opinions we&rsquo;ve built and have some real discussions. Everyone you meet has had different experiences and will perceive things in different ways.</p>

<p>My advice to you is simple. Strive to see the world through the eyes of others. You might find something you like.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered a useful productivity hack. I found that when I sat down to code it would take me a while to get back into the swing of things. I would have to struggle to figure out where I should start and what to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing a failing test just before I leave my work for the day. When I get back to work the next day, I simply run my tests, fix the failure as usual and I&rsquo;m back into my rhythm.</p>

<p>It only takes a minute or two to write a failing test but it saves me 10 to 15 minutes of trying to recover my mental state. <a href="mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you find this useful, or if you have any useful hacks/tips of your own.</p>

<p><strong>Powershop</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I set myself a goal. By the end of 2014, I would be living in Wellington making cool things for a living. I think I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>

<p>I started working at Powershop last week. Powershop is (as the name says) a shop for power.</p>

<p>I was quite fortunate in my job hunting, and ended up with four different offers from Wellington software companies to choose from.</p>

<p>I chose Powershop because they have a fantastic company culture, put out quality products, and treat their employees well. They also met my fixed requirement of having a ping pong table. Everyone I&rsquo;ve gotten to know there, so far, has been really cool. There is a healthy diversity of backgrounds and ideas at Powershop, which I really value.</p>

<p>As a new developer, you join the Dev Train, a special team where you just learn and improve. New devs spend up to three months working on games and other interesting projects to hone their skills before being consigned into production code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I originally posted this on Facebook, but I thought I would repost it here for posterity.</em></p>

<p>Someone recently told me something that made me think a bit. &lsquo;It gets better&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that a bit but I&rsquo;d never really about how it applied to me. I thought about how the last few years have been for me.</p>

<p>The last year or so of high school was pretty tough in terms of my emotional stability, and I found it really difficult to talk about with other people. Sometimes I would just feel down, for up to weeks at a time. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was just being lazy, or if this was just how things were.</p>

<p>It was even worse in that nothing was really wrong with my life. You feel even worse for feeling down, when you have every reason to be up.</p>

<p>I wanted to post this because I&rsquo;ve only recently started thinking that many other people actually go through this. Someone said something to me, so I figure I might pass it on. If you are having a tough time, if you can&rsquo;t shrug feeling down, it honestly gets better.</p>

<p>My life has been much better recently. I&rsquo;ve been in a much better place emotionally, and it&rsquo;s easier to feel good. I&rsquo;m working towards happiness being my default state.</p>

<p>I know this is definitely a bit weird to post on Facebook, but I think it&rsquo;s important to talk about. Hit me up if you want to chat about it (especially about controlling emotions), or comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dev Academy is over, for my cohort at least. A fresh batch of students will be arriving to start Phase 1 in just over a week.</p>

<p>Getting back to normal life is weird. You&rsquo;re with the same group of people, learning intensely for 10-12 hours almost every day, for 9 weeks straight. Dev Academy somehow doesn&rsquo;t feel like normal life, almost doesn&rsquo;t feel real, but it&rsquo;s much more real than normal life in some ways. Everyone is so honest and open. It&rsquo;s so supportive, and you&rsquo;re surrounded by the most incredible people.</p>

<p>The last day of Dev Academy was really touching. We presented our final projects in the morning. Richard, Andrew, Taylor and I had created Skirmish, a multiplayer war game played on Google Maps. I can&rsquo;t do justice to the presentations, so I will post the video once it&rsquo;s available. I was really impressed by the level of quality of each of the final projects, especially from the technically weaker team.</p>

<p>After that, we took our first field trip of the course, and headed up to Central Park. We did an exercise where everyone divides into two parallel rows, facing each other. Each person is in turn blindfolded and walks between the two rows. Each person standing quietly gives the blindfoldee a piece of praise as they pass.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a certain logistical problem I never really considered when I decided I was going to write weekly Dev Academy blog posts. As Dev Academy goes on, the amount of things going on increases. This means that there is not only more to write about, but also less time to write about it. To maybe combat that issue, I&rsquo;ve decided to try a little something different this time. Forget chronology, we&rsquo;re gonna check out some highlights. Less is more.</p>

<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m sitting on my couch writing this on the Sunday night at the end of Week 7 of Dev Academy. As of tomorrow, two weeks remain until graduation. Feels a bit mad.</p>

<p><strong>Learning comes first</strong>, both at Dev Academy and in this post. This is a maxim that has been drilled into us at Dev Academy. If the curriculum isn&rsquo;t working for you, throw it out. If there&rsquo;s something better you could be doing for your learning, do that instead.</p>

<p>I love this philosophy. I&rsquo;ve found I work best in an environment where I can create my own structure. As we&rsquo;ve moved into Phase 3 (the phase where we&rsquo;re treated more as developers, and less as students) we have more of an increased freedom to choose what we do. The first two phases of the course highly emphasized pairing (Pair Programming, two developers working together on the same computer on the same problem). Phase three is now solo optional all the time. I find that independent programming and then pairing on hard problems is a better way to work anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a hectic few weeks since my last post. We&rsquo;ve been hurtling through databases, team projects, web applications and more. I&rsquo;ve been busy putting off writing this post for two weeks, but here I am. Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>The start of week 3 has become a bit hazy now, so bear with me as I recollect. We spent the first few days dedicated to learning about databases and SQL (a language for talking to databases).</p>

<p>We started out by making applications that communicated with the database via raw SQL queries (not fun), then moved into making our own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> (Object-relational Mapper, a way to work with databases at a more abstract level, with objects in code). This was definitely a cool exercise, as most people will never write an ORM (because there&rsquo;s no real need to write your own).We then moved from there to using the most popular ORM for Ruby, ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is much easier and nicer to use than the ORMs we made ourselves, but it&rsquo;s definitely worthwhile to know how it works. Dev Academy often takes this approach, teaching you the internals out to flesh out your understanding. (I had made an ORM previously, called <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/butterdb">ButterDB</a>. It lets you use Google Spreadsheets as a database, and was originally a joke project.)</p>
