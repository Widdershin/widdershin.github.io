I'm Nick Johnstone. I'm a skater/hacker/entrepeneur currently living in Wellington, New Zealand.

I program things, mostly of a webby nature. Check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/Widdershin/).

If you want to talk, flick me an email at [ncwjohnstone@gmail.com](mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com).
