*I originally posted this on Facebook, but I thought I would repost it here for posterity.*

Someone recently told me something that made me think a bit. 'It gets better'.

I've heard that a bit but I'd never really about how it applied to me. I thought about how the last few years have been for me.

The last year or so of high school was pretty tough in terms of my emotional stability, and I found it really difficult to talk about with other people. Sometimes I would just feel down, for up to weeks at a time. I wasn't sure if I was just being lazy, or if this was just how things were.

It was even worse in that nothing was really wrong with my life. You feel even worse for feeling down, when you have every reason to be up.

I wanted to post this because I've only recently started thinking that many other people actually go through this. Someone said something to me, so I figure I might pass it on. If you are having a tough time, if you can't shrug feeling down, it honestly gets better.

My life has been much better recently. I've been in a much better place emotionally, and it's easier to feel good. I'm working towards happiness being my default state.

I know this is definitely a bit weird to post on Facebook, but I think it's important to talk about. Hit me up if you want to chat about it (especially about controlling emotions), or comment.
