I've recently discovered a useful productivity hack. I found that when I sat down to code it would take me a while to get back into the swing of things. I would have to struggle to figure out where I should start and what to do.

I've started writing a failing test just before I leave my work for the day. When I get back to work the next day, I simply run my tests, fix the failure as usual and I'm back into my rhythm.

It only takes a minute or two to write a failing test but it saves me 10 to 15 minutes of trying to recover my mental state. [Let me know](mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com) if you find this useful, or if you have any useful hacks/tips of your own.
