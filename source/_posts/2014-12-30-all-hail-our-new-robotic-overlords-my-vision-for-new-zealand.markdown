We humans spend a lot of time working. If you’re lucky, you only work 5 days out of 7 (in your life). On those days, you probably spend a fair bit over half your waking hours toiling. Why do people work so much?

In New Zealand, a large part of the reason people work is because they have to in order to afford basic comforts. Things like food, electricity, shelter, internet and transport.

Change is brewing though, and the active agent is technology. As tech improves, it’s becoming more and more viable to automate simple jobs, decreasing or eliminating the 
human element involved.

In my lifetime, many employees will be replaced by robots. Things like driving taxis, working fields, and many others can and will be automated. As a result, there will be less and less jobs available, especially labour and entry level positions. For many people, this is bad news, as it will become harder to afford their basic needs.

So what’s the good news? This is only a problem with the system as it currently exists.

We currently live in a society that is subject to scarcity. At the moment, in order to produce enough resources to support both the people of the country and the economy, the majority of people have to work. This is scarcity.

In a post scarcity society, we would have a surplus of resources. Enough to go around, without everyone having to work. If robots produce enough food for all of us to eat, why would humans need to do it?

But what about the people who have been replaced by robots? How will they survive?

I would suggest a system like a universal basic income, where the state would provide enough money to cover the basic necessities of life to everyone, regardless of employment status.

At the point, I’m often asked what would prevent someone from simply sitting around and doing nothing all day.

While it would be viable to spend your time sitting around, I would be very surprised if many people would. 

I feel most people would still work at least a little, to supplement the costs of what they want to do in life.

I can also imagine people pursuing education, science and the arts with a new relish.

Ask yourself this question. What would you do, if you didn’t have to work in order to live?
