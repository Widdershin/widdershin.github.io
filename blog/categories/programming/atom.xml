    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The world needs good games. We need good games, because they allow us to experience parts of life we would  otherwise never be able to.</p>

<p>When I was sixteen, I fell in love with downhill skateboarding. It started with a gentle slope by the entrance to my high school, riding my friend and teacher Mix&rsquo;s board. It escalated from there, and I was off on a roller-coaster ride of joy, friendship, pain and tragedy.</p>

<p>Downhill skateboarding is indescribable. No matter what I write, what videos I show you or what I say, I will never be able to communicate the tranquillity of skating down a beautiful hill with your friends. It&rsquo;s also risky, requires specialized gear, high skill levels for basic safety, transport, and access to appropriate hills. You probably won&rsquo;t get to try it for yourself.</p>

<p>Through good games, we can experience the indescribable. Good games let us live a broader and richer life. Good games make you laugh and cry. They make you long to start a family and cherish the little moments, and to run away and see the world. They give you a glimpse into what it might feel like to a soldier fighting for your life, or a skater hurtling into a hairpin at over 100km/h.</p>

<p>Good games are made by people who care, about games and art. Not all successful games are good and not all good games are successful. In any case, you are the judge.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m making a downhill skateboarding game. I&rsquo;m making it because I&rsquo;ve want to play it since I could skate, because I have the skills, and because I think it can make enough money to be self-supporting.</p>

<p>But above all, I&rsquo;m making it because the world needs to experience downhill skateboarding.</p>

<p>If I can capture a tiny part of the joy, adrenaline, fear and love that is downhill skateboarding, it will all have been worth it.</p>

<p>The world needs good games.
We need to make good games.
It&rsquo;s just that simple.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All too often when I&rsquo;m programming I find myself looking at a problem and feeling like I have no clue how to even begin.</p>

<p>In amongst the murky swamp of stress and self doubt there is a little spark of intuition. It&rsquo;s small, and fragile, but all I have to do is blow on it, feed it the fuel it needs to burn. Sometimes my intuition turns out to be wrong. But more often than not that fire shows me the light.</p>

<p>And you know what? I can&rsquo;t ever remember regretting having followed my intuition.</p>

<p>What haunts me is when I find that little spark and then ignore it. There&rsquo;s nothing more sickening than spending hours battling with a problem only to realize I knew the answer all along, if only I had trusted myself.</p>

<p>Now, when I come to a fork in the road. I try not to fret and fray and become paralyzed by choice. I strike out along a path and see what happens. At least that way I&rsquo;m going somewhere.</p>

<p>One of the great things about tmux is that you can create flexible development layouts.</p>

<p>You can easily display the output of a command and auto update it using <code>watch</code>. It has a similar end user experience as <code>tail -f</code>, except for commands instead of files. For example:</p>

<p><code>$ watch git status</code></p>

<p><code>watch</code> will run <code>git status</code> every 2 seconds and display the output.</p>

<p>If you want color in your <code>git status</code>, you&rsquo;ll need to configure git to display color when being run by <code>watch</code>.</p>

<p><code>$ git config --global color.status always</code>
<code>$ watch --color git status</code></p>

    <link href="http://widdersh.in/controlling-sonic-pi-from-vim-or-anywhere-else/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-10T23:13:08+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://widdersh.in/controlling-sonic-pi-from-vim-or-anywhere-else</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I discovered Sonic Pi. I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/117516352">Repl Electric</a> perform live at RubyConf AU. He gave a brief demo of Sonic Pi, a tool for progamming live music with Ruby. Instantly my eyes lit up. It was the instrument I&rsquo;d always wanted.</p>

<p>I tried it out the next day. It has a nice interface, but I&rsquo;m used to vim and living in the terminal. I googled &ldquo;vim sonic pi&rdquo;, but there was nothing I could see. I hunted round for a bit, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a command line interface either.</p>

<p>It was <a href="http://github.com/samaaron">Sam Aaron</a>  (the creator of Sonic Pi) who pointed me in the right direction, a blog post entitled <a href="https://joearms.github.io/2015/01/05/Connecting-Erlang-to-Sonic-Pi.html">Connecting Erlang to Sonic Pi</a>. It turned out that there was an undocumented method of controlling Sonic Pi externally.</p>

<p>The secret:
<code>ruby
require 'osc-ruby'
code = 'play 50' # or whatever you want
OSC::Client.new('localhost', 4557).send('/run-code', code)
</code></p>

<p>That code sends an OSC message (<a href="http://osw.sourceforge.net/html/osc.htm">Open Sound Control</a>) to Sonic Pi, instructing it to run the given code just as if you had typed it in.</p>

<p>So I put together a simple command line interface to use Sonic Pi from the terminal. <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli">sonic-pi-cli</a>. I packaged it up as a gem, and released it into the wild.</p>

<p>You can install it with <code>gem install sonic-pi-cli</code> and then run music with <code>sonic_pi play 60</code> or <code>echo 'sample :loop_amen' | sonic_pi</code>.</p>

<p>I was really happy to have a working CLI for Sonic Pi. I quickly whipped up some vim binds so I could use Sonic Pi right from my editor.</p>

<p><code>vim
noremap &lt;leader&gt;r :silent w !sonic_pi&lt;CR&gt;
noremap &lt;leader&gt;S :call system("sonic_pi stop")&lt;CR&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You can add these commands to your <code>.vimrc</code>, and voila, Sonic Pi in your vim. I use the spacebar as my leader key, so these shortcuts feel a lot like using Sonic Pi.</p>

<p>Now, the really amazing part comes. Less than a day since I first released <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli">sonic-pi-cli</a> on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sonic-pi-cli">RubyGems</a>, a few awesome projects have already put it to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rbnpi">Robin Newman</a> has used it to control Sonic Pi from his phone with a Raspberry Pi and telegram.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o-DY8qrm44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><a href="https://github.com/dermusikman">dermusikman</a> immediately started working on a vim plugin to bring as many features of Sonic Pi to vim as he can, <a href="https://github.com/dermusikman/sonicpi.vim">sonicpi.vim</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment, it contains the shortcuts from above, as well as auto completion for samples and the like, and the use of the .pi file format, with Ruby highlighting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely astounded by the awesome work that has been put out so rapidly by others in the community. I really love this aspect of open source. There&rsquo;s a good sense of collaboration through Github issues and <a href="https://gitter.im/samaaron/sonic-pi">gitter</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to contributing more to the Sonic Pi community in future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered a useful productivity hack. I found that when I sat down to code it would take me a while to get back into the swing of things. I would have to struggle to figure out where I should start and what to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing a failing test just before I leave my work for the day. When I get back to work the next day, I simply run my tests, fix the failure as usual and I&rsquo;m back into my rhythm.</p>

<p>It only takes a minute or two to write a failing test but it saves me 10 to 15 minutes of trying to recover my mental state. <a href="mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you find this useful, or if you have any useful hacks/tips of your own.</p>
