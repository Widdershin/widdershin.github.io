<p>One of the great things about tmux is that you can create flexible development layouts.</p>

<p>You can easily display the output of a command and auto update it using <code>watch</code>. It has a similar end user experience as <code>tail -f</code>, except for commands instead of files. For example:</p>

<p><code>$ watch git status</code></p>

<p><code>watch</code> will run <code>git status</code> every 2 seconds and display the output.</p>

<p>If you want color in your <code>git status</code>, you&rsquo;ll need to configure git to display color when being run by <code>watch</code>.</p>

<p><code>$ git config --global color.status always</code>
<code>$ watch --color git status</code></p>

    <link href="http://widdersh.in/controlling-sonic-pi-from-vim-or-anywhere-else/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-10T23:13:08+13:00</updated>
    <id>http://widdersh.in/controlling-sonic-pi-from-vim-or-anywhere-else</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I discovered Sonic Pi. I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/117516352">Repl Electric</a> perform live at RubyConf AU. He gave a brief demo of Sonic Pi, a tool for progamming live music with Ruby. Instantly my eyes lit up. It was the instrument I&rsquo;d always wanted.</p>

<p>I tried it out the next day. It has a nice interface, but I&rsquo;m used to vim and living in the terminal. I googled &ldquo;vim sonic pi&rdquo;, but there was nothing I could see. I hunted round for a bit, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a command line interface either.</p>

<p>It was <a href="http://github.com/samaaron">Sam Aaron</a>  (the creator of Sonic Pi) who pointed me in the right direction, a blog post entitled <a href="https://joearms.github.io/2015/01/05/Connecting-Erlang-to-Sonic-Pi.html">Connecting Erlang to Sonic Pi</a>. It turned out that there was an undocumented method of controlling Sonic Pi externally.</p>

<p>The secret:
<code>ruby
require 'osc-ruby'
code = 'play 50' # or whatever you want
OSC::Client.new('localhost', 4557).send('/run-code', code)
</code></p>

<p>That code sends an OSC message (<a href="http://osw.sourceforge.net/html/osc.htm">Open Sound Control</a>) to Sonic Pi, instructing it to run the given code just as if you had typed it in.</p>

<p>So I put together a simple command line interface to use Sonic Pi from the terminal. <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli">sonic-pi-cli</a>. I packaged it up as a gem, and released it into the wild.</p>

<p>You can install it with <code>gem install sonic-pi-cli</code> and then run music with <code>sonic_pi play 60</code> or <code>echo 'sample :loop_amen' | sonic_pi</code>.</p>

<p>I was really happy to have a working CLI for Sonic Pi. I quickly whipped up some vim binds so I could use Sonic Pi right from my editor.</p>

<p><code>vim
noremap &lt;leader&gt;r :silent w !sonic_pi&lt;CR&gt;
noremap &lt;leader&gt;S :call system("sonic_pi stop")&lt;CR&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You can add these commands to your <code>.vimrc</code>, and voila, Sonic Pi in your vim. I use the spacebar as my leader key, so these shortcuts feel a lot like using Sonic Pi.</p>

<p>Now, the really amazing part comes. Less than a day since I first released <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli">sonic-pi-cli</a> on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sonic-pi-cli">RubyGems</a>, a few awesome projects have already put it to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rbnpi">Robin Newman</a> has used it to control Sonic Pi from his phone with a Raspberry Pi and telegram.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o-DY8qrm44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><a href="https://github.com/dermusikman">dermusikman</a> immediately started working on a vim plugin to bring as many features of Sonic Pi to vim as he can, <a href="https://github.com/dermusikman/sonicpi.vim">sonicpi.vim</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment, it contains the shortcuts from above, as well as auto completion for samples and the like, and the use of the .pi file format, with Ruby highlighting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely astounded by the awesome work that has been put out so rapidly by others in the community. I really love this aspect of open source. There&rsquo;s a good sense of collaboration through Github issues and <a href="https://gitter.im/samaaron/sonic-pi">gitter</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to contributing more to the Sonic Pi community in future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered a useful productivity hack. I found that when I sat down to code it would take me a while to get back into the swing of things. I would have to struggle to figure out where I should start and what to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing a failing test just before I leave my work for the day. When I get back to work the next day, I simply run my tests, fix the failure as usual and I&rsquo;m back into my rhythm.</p>

<p>It only takes a minute or two to write a failing test but it saves me 10 to 15 minutes of trying to recover my mental state. <a href="mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you find this useful, or if you have any useful hacks/tips of your own.</p>

<p><strong>Powershop</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I set myself a goal. By the end of 2014, I would be living in Wellington making cool things for a living. I think I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>

<p>I started working at Powershop last week. Powershop is (as the name says) a shop for power.</p>

<p>I was quite fortunate in my job hunting, and ended up with four different offers from Wellington software companies to choose from.</p>

<p>I chose Powershop because they have a fantastic company culture, put out quality products, and treat their employees well. They also met my fixed requirement of having a ping pong table. Everyone I&rsquo;ve gotten to know there, so far, has been really cool. There is a healthy diversity of backgrounds and ideas at Powershop, which I really value.</p>

<p>As a new developer, you join the Dev Train, a special team where you just learn and improve. New devs spend up to three months working on games and other interesting projects to hone their skills before being consigned into production code.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ve been tasked with making a digital version of the board game, Ticket To Ride. I&rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to try some new things (like <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/learning/issues/1">BDD with Cucumber</a>), and I&rsquo;m learning a lot. It&rsquo;s such a great way to start a job.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been immensely enjoying my first few days of working at Powershop. I&rsquo;m also really stoked that they hired another Dev Academy graduate, my good friend Tim. It&rsquo;s cool that I get to continue working and learning with him.</p>

<p><strong>Depression and Mental Illness</strong></p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking quite a lot about depression and mental illness. I wrote a post recently about <a href="http://widdersh.in/on-being-down/">being down, and how life gets better</a>. Someone who happened to read it sent me an email, with a talk from Ruby Midwest by a developer with ADD and bipolar syndrome.</p>

<iframe width="670" height="376" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yFIa-Mc2KSk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>It hit home a bit. I&rsquo;ve never been tested for any mental illness, but now I think I will go talk to someone about it. I&rsquo;ve often had trouble reigning in my emotions and motivation, and the more I think about it the more I wonder.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s scary to talk about mental illness since society seems to still refuse to really open that door. I think that Depression and Co. live closer to home than people might realize. Just last week, the internet/world was ablaze with the news of Robin William&rsquo;s death, which appears to have been a suicide. To me, this is tragic and slightly heartbreaking. What scares me the most is that anyone I know could be feeling suicidal, which I probably have no idea.</p>

<p>I think that we need to talk more about mental illness, both in society and within the circle of friends and family. I admire my coworker Chelsea, and <a href="http://chelz.geek.nz/">her blog</a>. I was stunned and inspired to see her honesty about her struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>I would love to <a href="mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com">hear your thoughts</a> on any of this. If this section makes you feel uncomfortable, that&rsquo;s fine, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable too.</p>

<p><strong>butterdb</strong></p>

<p>I was really delighted last Saturday, after someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8123450">posted a library</a> I had made (<a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/butterdb">butterdb</a>) on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and it got up to number 3 and stayed there for a while. butterdb is a library for Python that lets you work with data in Google Spreadsheets as objects. It&rsquo;s like an ORM.</p>

<p>For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Hacker News, I&rsquo;ll explain why this made me giggle like a child. Hacker News is the forum section of <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">ycombinator</a>, a well renowned startup incubator. If your tech business gets to the top, you have either done very well or very badly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited because it appears that people actually use butterdb now. I&rsquo;ve got a whole load of features to implement, and I plan on rewriting the entire library at some point this month. Mostly, I just wanted to brag a bit :).</p>

    <link href="http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-the-end/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-25T20:29:48+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-the-end</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dev Academy is over, for my cohort at least. A fresh batch of students will be arriving to start Phase 1 in just over a week.</p>

<p>Getting back to normal life is weird. You&rsquo;re with the same group of people, learning intensely for 10-12 hours almost every day, for 9 weeks straight. Dev Academy somehow doesn&rsquo;t feel like normal life, almost doesn&rsquo;t feel real, but it&rsquo;s much more real than normal life in some ways. Everyone is so honest and open. It&rsquo;s so supportive, and you&rsquo;re surrounded by the most incredible people.</p>

<p>The last day of Dev Academy was really touching. We presented our final projects in the morning. Richard, Andrew, Taylor and I had created Skirmish, a multiplayer war game played on Google Maps. I can&rsquo;t do justice to the presentations, so I will post the video once it&rsquo;s available. I was really impressed by the level of quality of each of the final projects, especially from the technically weaker team.</p>

<p>After that, we took our first field trip of the course, and headed up to Central Park. We did an exercise where everyone divides into two parallel rows, facing each other. Each person is in turn blindfolded and walks between the two rows. Each person standing quietly gives the blindfoldee a piece of praise as they pass.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It sounds terribly cheesy. I personally found it overwhelmingly positive to go through. As the blindfoldee (is that even a word?) you hear a rush of feedback, and you can only really grab onto it as it passes. It&rsquo;s more of a surge of goodwill than anything.</p>

<p>We headed back to Dev Academy after that, did some final exercises as a cohort, and then kicked off the graduation party at the Southern Cross. That was a fun night.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had quite a few people ask me if I feel Dev Academy was worth it. Dev Academy is quite a lot of money, and it&rsquo;s 9 weeks solid booked in your life. For me, Dev Academy was 100% worth it. It was one of the best experiences I&rsquo;ve had in my life. I grew so much technically, but I think I grew an order of magnitude more as a person.</p>

<p>Some people want to see the money though, and that makes sense. I would say most of the people who went to Dev Academy did so to drastically change or improve their career. Almost all of the students started job hunting immediately. Rohan from Dev Academy has been a huge help with that. In the week after Dev Academy, he ran an optional course helping students improve their CVs and interview skills. He&rsquo;s also helped us find and get to know companies we would like to work at. Wellington is starved for tech talent at the moment as well, so things are looking good. I&rsquo;m confident that all of people in my cohort will find a good job.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve personally been job hunting and doing some part time web development work for a skateshop. I really enjoy skate related work, so I was glad to pick that opportunity up. I&rsquo;ve had a few interviews at Wellington tech companies so far, and there a few options I&rsquo;m really interested in. I want to find a good fit though, so I&rsquo;m making sure I hunt around a bit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got some ideas for personal projects brewing. I have a few left over from Dev Academy that just need a little bit of polishing and they&rsquo;ll be ready to ship. I had a bright idea last night, but the more I look into it, the more I&rsquo;m realizing it would easily be my most ambitious project yet. There is always so much more to learn.</p>

<p>I spent last weekend down in Christchurch. It was really nice to get to catch up with my friends and family (and pets), and to sleep a lot. It helped me to unwind from Dev Academy, and to get back to reality a bit.</p>

<p>I hope this post ties up the end of my Dev Academy story a little bit. Thanks to anyone who has been a reader of my blog so far. If you want to read from the start, check out the <a href="/blog/archives">archives</a> I plan on keeping it up. I mostly feel like writing  about technology, education and life, but we will see I suppose.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or thoughts.</p>
