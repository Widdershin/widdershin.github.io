<p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered a useful productivity hack. I found that when I sat down to code it would take me a while to get back into the swing of things. I would have to struggle to figure out where I should start and what to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing a failing test just before I leave my work for the day. When I get back to work the next day, I simply run my tests, fix the failure as usual and I&rsquo;m back into my rhythm.</p>

<p>It only takes a minute or two to write a failing test but it saves me 10 to 15 minutes of trying to recover my mental state. <a href="mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you find this useful, or if you have any useful hacks/tips of your own.</p>

<p><strong>Powershop</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I set myself a goal. By the end of 2014, I would be living in Wellington making cool things for a living. I think I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>

<p>I started working at Powershop last week. Powershop is (as the name says) a shop for power.</p>

<p>I was quite fortunate in my job hunting, and ended up with four different offers from Wellington software companies to choose from.</p>

<p>I chose Powershop because they have a fantastic company culture, put out quality products, and treat their employees well. They also met my fixed requirement of having a ping pong table. Everyone I&rsquo;ve gotten to know there, so far, has been really cool. There is a healthy diversity of backgrounds and ideas at Powershop, which I really value.</p>

<p>As a new developer, you join the Dev Train, a special team where you just learn and improve. New devs spend up to three months working on games and other interesting projects to hone their skills before being consigned into production code.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ve been tasked with making a digital version of the board game, Ticket To Ride. I&rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to try some new things (like <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/learning/issues/1">BDD with Cucumber</a>), and I&rsquo;m learning a lot. It&rsquo;s such a great way to start a job.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been immensely enjoying my first few days of working at Powershop. I&rsquo;m also really stoked that they hired another Dev Academy graduate, my good friend Tim. It&rsquo;s cool that I get to continue working and learning with him.</p>

<p><strong>Depression and Mental Illness</strong></p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking quite a lot about depression and mental illness. I wrote a post recently about <a href="http://widdersh.in/on-being-down/">being down, and how life gets better</a>. Someone who happened to read it sent me an email, with a talk from Ruby Midwest by a developer with ADD and bipolar syndrome.</p>

<iframe width="670" height="376" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yFIa-Mc2KSk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>It hit home a bit. I&rsquo;ve never been tested for any mental illness, but now I think I will go talk to someone about it. I&rsquo;ve often had trouble reigning in my emotions and motivation, and the more I think about it the more I wonder.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s scary to talk about mental illness since society seems to still refuse to really open that door. I think that Depression and Co. live closer to home than people might realize. Just last week, the internet/world was ablaze with the news of Robin William&rsquo;s death, which appears to have been a suicide. To me, this is tragic and slightly heartbreaking. What scares me the most is that anyone I know could be feeling suicidal, which I probably have no idea.</p>

<p>I think that we need to talk more about mental illness, both in society and within the circle of friends and family. I admire my coworker Chelsea, and <a href="http://chelz.geek.nz/">her blog</a>. I was stunned and inspired to see her honesty about her struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>I would love to <a href="mailto:ncwjohnstone@gmail.com">hear your thoughts</a> on any of this. If this section makes you feel uncomfortable, that&rsquo;s fine, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable too.</p>

<p><strong>butterdb</strong></p>

<p>I was really delighted last Saturday, after someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8123450">posted a library</a> I had made (<a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/butterdb">butterdb</a>) on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and it got up to number 3 and stayed there for a while. butterdb is a library for Python that lets you work with data in Google Spreadsheets as objects. It&rsquo;s like an ORM.</p>

<p>For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Hacker News, I&rsquo;ll explain why this made me giggle like a child. Hacker News is the forum section of <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">ycombinator</a>, a well renowned startup incubator. If your tech business gets to the top, you have either done very well or very badly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited because it appears that people actually use butterdb now. I&rsquo;ve got a whole load of features to implement, and I plan on rewriting the entire library at some point this month. Mostly, I just wanted to brag a bit :).</p>

    <link href="http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-the-end/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-25T20:29:48+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-the-end</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dev Academy is over, for my cohort at least. A fresh batch of students will be arriving to start Phase 1 in just over a week.</p>

<p>Getting back to normal life is weird. You&rsquo;re with the same group of people, learning intensely for 10-12 hours almost every day, for 9 weeks straight. Dev Academy somehow doesn&rsquo;t feel like normal life, almost doesn&rsquo;t feel real, but it&rsquo;s much more real than normal life in some ways. Everyone is so honest and open. It&rsquo;s so supportive, and you&rsquo;re surrounded by the most incredible people.</p>

<p>The last day of Dev Academy was really touching. We presented our final projects in the morning. Richard, Andrew, Taylor and I had created Skirmish, a multiplayer war game played on Google Maps. I can&rsquo;t do justice to the presentations, so I will post the video once it&rsquo;s available. I was really impressed by the level of quality of each of the final projects, especially from the technically weaker team.</p>

<p>After that, we took our first field trip of the course, and headed up to Central Park. We did an exercise where everyone divides into two parallel rows, facing each other. Each person is in turn blindfolded and walks between the two rows. Each person standing quietly gives the blindfoldee a piece of praise as they pass.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It sounds terribly cheesy. I personally found it overwhelmingly positive to go through. As the blindfoldee (is that even a word?) you hear a rush of feedback, and you can only really grab onto it as it passes. It&rsquo;s more of a surge of goodwill than anything.</p>

<p>We headed back to Dev Academy after that, did some final exercises as a cohort, and then kicked off the graduation party at the Southern Cross. That was a fun night.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had quite a few people ask me if I feel Dev Academy was worth it. Dev Academy is quite a lot of money, and it&rsquo;s 9 weeks solid booked in your life. For me, Dev Academy was 100% worth it. It was one of the best experiences I&rsquo;ve had in my life. I grew so much technically, but I think I grew an order of magnitude more as a person.</p>

<p>Some people want to see the money though, and that makes sense. I would say most of the people who went to Dev Academy did so to drastically change or improve their career. Almost all of the students started job hunting immediately. Rohan from Dev Academy has been a huge help with that. In the week after Dev Academy, he ran an optional course helping students improve their CVs and interview skills. He&rsquo;s also helped us find and get to know companies we would like to work at. Wellington is starved for tech talent at the moment as well, so things are looking good. I&rsquo;m confident that all of people in my cohort will find a good job.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve personally been job hunting and doing some part time web development work for a skateshop. I really enjoy skate related work, so I was glad to pick that opportunity up. I&rsquo;ve had a few interviews at Wellington tech companies so far, and there a few options I&rsquo;m really interested in. I want to find a good fit though, so I&rsquo;m making sure I hunt around a bit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got some ideas for personal projects brewing. I have a few left over from Dev Academy that just need a little bit of polishing and they&rsquo;ll be ready to ship. I had a bright idea last night, but the more I look into it, the more I&rsquo;m realizing it would easily be my most ambitious project yet. There is always so much more to learn.</p>

<p>I spent last weekend down in Christchurch. It was really nice to get to catch up with my friends and family (and pets), and to sleep a lot. It helped me to unwind from Dev Academy, and to get back to reality a bit.</p>

<p>I hope this post ties up the end of my Dev Academy story a little bit. Thanks to anyone who has been a reader of my blog so far. If you want to read from the start, check out the <a href="/blog/archives">archives</a> I plan on keeping it up. I mostly feel like writing  about technology, education and life, but we will see I suppose.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or thoughts.</p>

    <link href="http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-week-5-through-8-subtitle-undefined/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-04T23:45:00+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-week-5-through-8-subtitle-undefined</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a certain logistical problem I never really considered when I decided I was going to write weekly Dev Academy blog posts. As Dev Academy goes on, the amount of things going on increases. This means that there is not only more to write about, but also less time to write about it. To maybe combat that issue, I&rsquo;ve decided to try a little something different this time. Forget chronology, we&rsquo;re gonna check out some highlights. Less is more.</p>

<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m sitting on my couch writing this on the Sunday night at the end of Week 7 of Dev Academy. As of tomorrow, two weeks remain until graduation. Feels a bit mad.</p>

<p><strong>Learning comes first</strong>, both at Dev Academy and in this post. This is a maxim that has been drilled into us at Dev Academy. If the curriculum isn&rsquo;t working for you, throw it out. If there&rsquo;s something better you could be doing for your learning, do that instead.</p>

<p>I love this philosophy. I&rsquo;ve found I work best in an environment where I can create my own structure. As we&rsquo;ve moved into Phase 3 (the phase where we&rsquo;re treated more as developers, and less as students) we have more of an increased freedom to choose what we do. The first two phases of the course highly emphasized pairing (Pair Programming, two developers working together on the same computer on the same problem). Phase three is now solo optional all the time. I find that independent programming and then pairing on hard problems is a better way to work anyway.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I appreciate the ability to direct my learning a bit more. I&rsquo;ve been hard at work rewriting my website <a href="http://www.nzskatesearch.com/">NZ Skate Search</a> in Ruby on Rails (a web framework that is the emphasis of the Ruby stream at Dev Academy). I originally wrote it in Python with Flask, but it was a bit of a hack job and had no tests. I&rsquo;ve been working on writing the new version in the best way I can. I&rsquo;m using heavy test driven development and emphasizing best practice. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to take this time to work on my craftsmanship.</p>

<p>That project is by no means strictly within the scope of the curriculum, but since I&rsquo;m hitting all of my learning objectives, that&rsquo;s what counts. In the biggest team project yet (whole cohort), we were assigned tasks and roles tailored entirely around our learning objectives.</p>

<p>Sometimes the set work clashes with my ability to best learn. The curriculum licensed from Dev Bootcamp San Francisco isn&rsquo;t as up to scratch as was expected. This is not really a problem, as we (as a school) can steer ourselves. Samson, the teacher for the Ruby stream, consults us every morning as to what lectures or breakout sessions we would like today (if any). These are mostly optional, so we have effectively been left to our own devices.</p>

<p>I have to say that this has enabled some of the best learning I&rsquo;ve seen so far this course. In the last week, Kendall and Andrew created an <a href="https://github.com/kendallflutey/rspec-controller-testing">open source template</a> for testing website controllers in Ruby. Genevieve and Richard have been working on a website to help organize code tips and breakout sesssions. Everyone is up to different stuff, and I think that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>

<p><strong>Working 75+ hours a week is rough</strong>, no matter who you are. This is on the lesser side of some of what my fellow cohorts members have been hitting, so credit to them.</p>

<p>I have been pretty tired for the last 3 weeks. Working so much every week gets to you. It makes it harder to get out of bed in the morning, and then to pay attention when I get to course. I&rsquo;ve been trying to eat well (-ish) and get enough sleep, but 7.5 hours a night seems to be draining me.</p>

<p>I find Yoga to be an excellent way to unwind. We&rsquo;ve had it twice a week since the start of the course. It&rsquo;s optional, and I think only around 5 of us out of 13 still partake. I often find I have quite a sore back, and Yoga really helps with that. I appreciate that it&rsquo;s a nice midpoint between meditation and exercise. It helps me to relax both my body and my mind (as cheesy as that might sound). I definitely want to keep up with it after EDA.</p>

<p>I also try and make some time for mindfulness. Although the Engineering Empathy curriculum finished at the end of Phase 2, Joshua, a teacher, still offers sessions for those who want to partake. Part of these sessions is mindfulness. Mindfulness exercises are simple. Find a comfortable place to sit, where you can find a balance between relaxation and alertness. Begin paying exclusive attention to your breath. Try to notice when your attention slips away, and gently refocus it on your breath.</p>

<p>The point of this exercise is simple. Improve your attention by exercising it. Improve your awareness of your attention by exercising that.</p>

<p>We do this for several minutes. I tend to shut my eyes. You can also try counting to see how long you can go without distraction. This is also a really good way to relax, and calm your mind.</p>

<p><em>writing ceases for a week</em></p>

<p><strong>Suddenly, it&rsquo;s Friday night, 5 days later.</strong> I&rsquo;ve been meaning to finish this post since Sunday, but have only just found the time. It&rsquo;s a week until the end of Dev Academy. If it feels like time has flown through these blog posts, then I feel that&rsquo;s only indicative of real life.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve just started our final team projects yesterday. Richard, Taylor, Andrew and I are working on Skirmish. It&rsquo;s a multiplayer turn based war game (like Risk) played on Google Maps. Final projects are the most intense part of Dev Academy. We coded for around 11 hours today. Richard and Andrew were still going when I left. This is easily the largest and most complex application I&rsquo;ve been involved in building.</p>

<p>We spent around 4 hours planning out our initial vision, user stories and architecture. Taylor (my flatmate and good friend) took the role of Architecture/Tech Lead. Since we want Skirmish to be multiplayer, we have to design the architecture with that in mind from the get go.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GhvdbPk.jpg" alt="Imgur" />
<em>Skirmish Architecture Planning</em></p>

<p>Richard pitched the idea for Skirmish, and took on the role of project lead. He lead us in developing user stories for requirements. We decided what we wanted to include for the MVP (minimum viable product) and we ended up with a fairly large project still. We want a functioning game with multiplayer, where players can capture other cities and fight. Ideally an MVP is as simple as possible, but even our smallest vision has a lot of moving pieces.</p>

<p>We have until next Friday morning to do as much as we can on Skirmish. As always, learning comes first. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter if the product that comes out the other side is perfect, as long as you learned lots and had a good time. That said, we&rsquo;re working hard. Every member of our team will be working every day until it&rsquo;s over. Lots and lots of coding.</p>

<p>You can check out the code for Skirmish on <a href="http://github.com/rantgames">Github</a>.</p>

<p>I am barely awake at this point, so I figure I should just post this (good idea, right?). There is so much that could be written about that I have missed or forgotten. The last few weeks have been unique, to say the least. It&rsquo;s hard to express in English, so permit some Ruby code instead.</p>

<p>```
def how_have_i_been?
  week_adjectives = [</p>

<pre><code>'tiring',
'interesting',
'learning-y(?)',
'hectic',
'hard',
'inspiring',
'slightly crazy',
'intense',
'awesome'
</code></pre>

<p>  ]</p>

<p>  *all_but_last, last = week_adjectives</p>

<p>  all_the_adjectives = &ldquo;#{all_but_last.join &lsquo;, &rsquo;} and #{last}.&rdquo;</p>

<p>  puts &ldquo;The last couple of weeks have been #{all_the_adjectives}&rdquo;
end</p>

<p>how_have_i_been?
```
Outputs: &ldquo;The last couple of weeks have been tiring, interesting, learning-y(?), hectic, hard, inspiring, slightly crazy, intense and awesome.&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-week-3-and-4-a-new-era/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-10T23:43:29+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://widdersh.in/dev-academy-week-3-and-4-a-new-era</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a hectic few weeks since my last post. We&rsquo;ve been hurtling through databases, team projects, web applications and more. I&rsquo;ve been busy putting off writing this post for two weeks, but here I am. Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>The start of week 3 has become a bit hazy now, so bear with me as I recollect. We spent the first few days dedicated to learning about databases and SQL (a language for talking to databases).</p>

<p>We started out by making applications that communicated with the database via raw SQL queries (not fun), then moved into making our own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> (Object-relational Mapper, a way to work with databases at a more abstract level, with objects in code). This was definitely a cool exercise, as most people will never write an ORM (because there&rsquo;s no real need to write your own).We then moved from there to using the most popular ORM for Ruby, ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is much easier and nicer to use than the ORMs we made ourselves, but it&rsquo;s definitely worthwhile to know how it works. Dev Academy often takes this approach, teaching you the internals out to flesh out your understanding. (I had made an ORM previously, called <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/butterdb">ButterDB</a>. It lets you use Google Spreadsheets as a database, and was originally a joke project.)</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We start off every week on Monday morning with a retrospective of the previous week. As a cohort, we go over how we felt about the previous week. What went well, what didn&rsquo;t go so well, and what we&rsquo;d like to change going forward. We also cover the things we wanted to change from the previous week&rsquo;s retrospective, and make sure that they are happening. There have been changes like improvements to the coding challenges, adjustments of coach times and solo days. I think this is a super valuable process, and  I&rsquo;ve found it novel to reflect in a group like that. It helps to ensure a feeling of participation and change.</p>

<p>On Thursday and Friday we had our second team project. We were told to build something we wanted to build, with some deadlines. We had a feature freeze (no adding features after that) at 3.30pm on Friday and a code freeze at 4.30pm. We were to give a presentation and demo at 5pm.</p>

<p>Our team (Richard, Hannah, Genevieve and myself) decided to build a text based adventure game (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>). We built the (very creatively named) <a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/text-based-adventure">text-based-adventure</a> game by Friday afternoon. It&rsquo;s fully featured (including fighting, looting and death), but sparse on content. I think 5 rooms made it into the demo we had.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like to play.</p>

<blockquote><p>λ ruby game.rb <br/>
Welcome to generic text adventure!<br/>
You are in the throne room. There is gold and ruby everywhere. You can see a corridor lined with spiderwebs to the west and there is a small water closet to the east. Make your move!<br/>
There are 50 gems in this room.<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 0<br/>
> loot<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 50<br/>
> go west<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 50<br/>
> look<br/>
Welcome and close the door. Hiding behind the cistern (what are you doing down there) is a box with silver chains in it. There is a small window to the north that leads out onto a firest rife with. The only other option is down the cistern but it appears to be blocked. Where would you like to go?<br/>
There are 3 gems in this room.<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 50<br/>
> go north<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 50<br/>
> look<br/>
You are in a forest. You hear a flapping of scaly wings. There are gold goblets and precious jewels in potholes in the smouldered ground. Take some and run if you dare, or face your doom.<br/>
There are 100 gems in this room.<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 50<br/>
> loot<br/>
Health: 100, Gems: 150</p></blockquote>

<p>(I think we forgot to include enemies in the demo, but they&rsquo;re in there somewhere)</p>

<p>I had a really great time working on this game. Our team worked really well together; we communicated and organized effectively. We had a big focus on automated testing, and I think that really helped on the tech side.</p>

<p>Friday was the final day of Phase 1 of Dev Academy. The course is three phases, with the first covering general development, the second covering web development, and the third being project focused.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still astounded at the immense growth and learning that my fellow cohort members have shown. The problems we&rsquo;re tackling now are so much harder than when we began, and they keep rising to the task. I learnt a lot of what I know on my own, and it&rsquo;s definitely much slower. I think Dev Academy&rsquo;s environment lends itself very well to rapid learning. You have the right mix of enthusiasm, passionate people and resources.</p>

<p>We celebrated the end of the phase with a sweet party, of course. It was cool to hang out with some of the other cohort members and relax, play some games on the project, and have some free food and drinks. It was really cool of the course (via course wizard/admin Rohan) to so generously provide food and booze.</p>

<p>Week 4 began and we kicked off phase 2 (the web development phase of Dev Academy). I know a lot of my fellow students were eager to move away from making command line applications, into something that more people can use and see.</p>

<p>We spent the first few days learning the basics of web development, and making progressively more intricate sites. I found a couple particularly fun. One was on Tuesday, when we were tasked with creating a basic clone of Craigslist. It was a simple listing site, but it was cool piecing it together in a well designed way, and helping the other cohort members build one of their first proper websites.</p>

<p>The other particularly enjoyable challenge was to build a simple login system. I was pairing with Taylor, my friend and flatmate, and he and I decided to take a different tack. We ended up building an authentication system that would let you log in, and then send a link to your friends so they would be logged in as you. Not a good idea, but fun to make and humorous (if you&rsquo;re a programmer I suppose).</p>

<p>On Thursday and Friday we built our third team project. We were tasked with either building a functional clone of Twitter or a Flashcards web app. All three of the teams opted to build the Twitter clone.</p>

<p>We built another creatively named app, Twytter.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/iCC8uPX.png" alt="Twytter" /></p>

<p>Some minor styling issues aside, I was really happy with what we delivered at 5pm. All of the features (like tweeting, retweeting, following, the feed, etc) were functional and complete. We also managed to get in the bonus customer feature, favorite tweets. We were given that feature request late on Friday afternoon, to see how we handled changing requirements.</p>

<p>I worked with Richard, Kendall and Tim. All of the teams were employing a method of building software called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a>. Agile is a way of running software teams that helps rapid, flexible development. It&rsquo;s well used in the industry, and was a great way of running our project. It has nice ways of tracking progress (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban Boards</a> and Sprints). I don&rsquo;t really want to go into detail here, so I definitely suggest readers do some reading if they&rsquo;re interested.</p>

<p>We definitely took a few lessons away from this team project. For one, we opted to deal with all of our presentation and styling at the end, rather than alongside feature building. This meant that it was more difficult than it needed to be to piece everything together.</p>

<p>We also made the mistake of not defining a clear scope of what we wanted to build, and by when. We were provided with a bunch of user stories (a way of phrasing a project feature or requirement, like &lsquo;As a user I can post a tweet.&rsquo;) We built all of those stories by the deadline, but as Richard pointed out, we could have dropped a feature in exchange for much more polish elsewhere.</p>

<p>I always enjoy the team exercises at Dev Academy. It&rsquo;s nice to work together with a larger group of people to make something that is hopefully more than the sum of its parts. I have been focusing on taking less of a leadership role during these projects, as I have a bit of a tendency to take that up if nobody seems too inclined. I want to let others take the lead more, and see how that goes.</p>

<p>On Thursday night we had another Dev Academy tech talk. Free pizza, beer and good company included, the entire evening was a treat. This time, Kirk Jackson (Xero&rsquo;s Security Officer) gave a talk about encryption and security, entitled &ldquo;Tales from Beyond the Crypto&rdquo;. Kirk was an excellent speaker, and it was a well timed topic, as we had just started building authentication for our projects. A lot of programmers never learn about crypto or security best practices, so I think it&rsquo;s awesome the the Dev Academy students got a good exposure to it. I know it definitely inspired some of my fellow students to think more seriously about getting into security.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s about all I can muster the effort to say at this point. Hopefully I can crack the next post out next weekend, but definitely soon. As always, any feedback appreciated.</p>
